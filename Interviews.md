# Interviews
* What are the different technical systems involved in managing affordable housing programs in New York? For example, which systems store resident application data, housing inventory, lottery information?
* Where do these systems fit into the “life cycle” of an applicant? Where are they needed in each step of the application process?
* Are there any other tools used by program staff or other stakeholders to manage these processes?
* How are these systems developed and managed? Are they procured third-party software systems, or are they developed and managed in-house?
* Do these data systems have data export or integration functionality (for example, an API, a file export, an accessible database)? Or are they locked in/proprietary?
* Are there any systems that should “talk” to each other but don’t? What are the challenges associated with integrating these systems? (e.g. legal, technical, process/operational, organizational, capacity constraints).
* What are the key entry points into the application process for individuals (whether websites, in-person visits with community organizations, or other channels?) Who manages each entrypoint? How does a person’s initial entrypoint affect their journey through the application process?
* What outreach or communication systems do you have to communicate with applicants (e.g. provide updates on application status or availability of new housing)?
* What cross-program or cross-agency data sharing do you do? E.g. referrals from other programs, benefits eligibility linkage, information re-use?
* What are the challenges associated with such data sharing? What opportunities do you see? What do you need to be successful?
