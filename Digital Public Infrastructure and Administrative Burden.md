# Digital Public Infrastructure and Administrative Burden
Rasmi Elasmar

## Introduction
* Introducing concept of administrative burden, digital public infrastructure, why these are fundamental to how government serves communities and in the general interest.

## Technology and administrative burdens
* Burdens as a tradeoff of time, labor, money, etc. shouldered either by government or by residents (or third parties). 
	* But not a zero-sum tradeoff -- better policy and implementation (including through technical improvements) can lessen burdens for residents and governments.
		* Admittedly, shifting burdens can be worse than zero-sum, e.g. having government staff manually re-submit an online application into another system -- but these costs can be explicitly accounted for on principle to reduce burdens on residents.
* Technology as a tool to reduce burdens through:
	* sharing information
	* facilitating discovery and delivery
	* organizing documents/recordkeeping
	* managing processes
	* reducing toil
* These programs are costly to administer and accesss for governments and residents. Technical improvements readily justify themselves if they sufficiently reduce burdens or expand access.
* Centralizing administration and operations gives greater leverage for technical improvements.

## Audit of NYC benefits and services
* A birds-eye view of e.g. HRA, housing, other core benefits and services systems. What is the life cycle of resident's data across programs? What are the processes and technologies involved at each step?
	* See: Local Law 60 Report, Local Law 75 Report

## Challenges
Why hasn't this been done? What are the technical, operational, organizational, and other challenges associated with creating such infrastructure?

### Operational challenges
* Challenges related to how programs are designed, implemented, and administered (and the role technology plays in each phase). Determined primarily by policy and administrative decisionmaking in the broader context of each organization/program.
* e.g. process changes, policy requirements, legal requirements, etc. 
* These can be remedied by strong executive/administrative decisionmaking and/or policy changes (it is generally a deliberate choice that can be readily modified).

### Organizational challenges
* Challenges within and across programs related to enacting technical/operational change. Determined primarily by political priorities and concerns, conflicting requirements/needs/incentives, resource constraints, capacity, ability.
* e.g. political will to change, resources necessary to change, technical skill and capacity, procurement challenges
* These may require long-term changes, additional resources, restructuring of incentives, political or organizational will, and capacity development.

### Technical challenges
* Challenges directly related to technical feasibility or implementation. 
* e.g. specific tool interoperability, data management, existence/availability of technology, usability/accessibility of technology, and complexity of technology.
* These problems can be remedied in part by the development of better technologies.

### Security & privacy needs
* Essential facets of managing resident data that may be at odds with other goals (e.g. cross-agency data sharing)
* Data sharing, ownership, consent, management, auditing, protection from unwanted access/abuse.

## Opportunities
### Resident-centered services
* What changes can be made to more holistically provide benefits and services to residents, to design the experience primarily from the perspective of the resident rather than individual programs and departments?

#### Proactive service delivery
* What changes could be implemented to shift as much of the burden of delivery onto government as possible? How can these changes be implemented?
	* Rules-as-code for automatic enrollment and renewal
	* Data standardization and sharing across agencies rather than requiring individuals to submit information.
	* Proactive outreach via text and other channels
	* Proactive cross-enrollment
	* Partial eligibility determination to inform applicants of potential eligibility (and what other conditions / information may be necessary)
	* Pre-assessing likely procedural denials
	* Holistic assessment of needs rather than program-by-program.

#### Models for shared data
* Centrally managed by a single agency
* Distributed across agencies, conforming to a standard, unified as-needed
* Individuals as data-holders (or unifiers/conduits, pulling and sharing data as needed)
	* Zero-knowledge verification

### Strategies for shifting burdens
Summary/taxonomy of ways that burdens can be shifted, especially things that can be readily implemented.

### Long-term development
#### Building blocks of digital public infrastructure

#### Incentive alignment
* How can the needs of residents be centered in how agencies operate and are evaluated?
	* E.g. CfA Safety Net Scorecard
	* Comparison to current measures in Mayor's Management Report

### Transparency & oversight
* How can data use and sharing be managed transparently?
* How can inequities, bias, and discrimination in both policy and implementation be more proactively identified and addressed?

## Beyond administrative burden
Even if we leverage technical tools to make the improvements described above, the biggest determinant of social outcomes is policy and implementation.

### Limitations of technology
